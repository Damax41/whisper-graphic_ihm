# Whisper Graphic IHM v1.1.0

> **Damax41** - *DÃ©veloppeur* - [Link](https://github.com/Damax41)

## Overview

Whisper Graphic IHM is a user-friendly application that allows you to transcribe audio files using the Whisper Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. This application provides a simple graphical user interface to select audio files and the desired transcription model. The transcriptions can be viewed within the app and saved to a text file.

## New in v1.1.0

- **Updated Retranscript class :** The `Retranscript` class has been updated for better code structure and more control over the transcription process.

- **Direct transcription method :** The Whisper model's direct transcription method is now used for transcribing audio files.

- **Improved user interface :** Users can now select an audio file and a transcription model from the main menu. A progress bar has been added to show the transcription process, and a results view has been added to display the transcription and offer options to save the transcription or return to the main menu.

- **Better error handling :** Error messages are now displayed to the user in a more user-friendly way.

- **Multithreading support :** The transcription process now runs in a separate thread to prevent blocking the GUI. This change was facilitated by the introduction of a new Monitor class.
